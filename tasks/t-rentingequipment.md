#Renting Equipment Process

To enhance your _AirClassroom_ experience, there are laptops,
iPad Pros, and videocameras available for rent.

If you are interested in renting any of these devices, read the following steps.

1. Contact Rob Jacks via [email](rjacks@vt.edu) or phone (540-231-5784) at least 24 hours before you need the equipment, and inform him of your needs. This includes the date and time of when you need the devices, how many you need, as well as the amount of time you will need to keep them.
2. After getting the confirmation from Rob, you will need to decide a convenient time to meet with him to obtain the devices.
3. Request any carts or boxes needed to carry the equipment.
4. Check the devices for any damages, and request a Damages Sheet to list them before checking the equipment out.
5. Pay Rob the agreed amount.
6. Sign the Renting Sign-Out Sheet, listing everything you are borrowing, as well as the amount of money you paid and the date you are returning them by.

If equipment is lost or damaged, extra fees will apply.
