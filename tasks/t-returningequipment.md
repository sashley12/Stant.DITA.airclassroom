#Returning Equipment Process

Be sure to confirm with Rob how long you need the equipment and that you both are on the same page to avoid any extra fees.

1. Make sure you have all of the rented equipment with no damages and any boxes or carts you borrowed as well.
2. To return the equipment, meet Rob at his alotted office hours, or schedule an appointment with him if they do not work for you.
3. Sign the Renting Sign-Out Sheet ensuring that you returned the devices within the alotted timeframe.
